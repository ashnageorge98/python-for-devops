Hereâ€™s a simple Python code snippet that demonstrates various file handling concepts in a straightforward way. 
This example simulates a basic logging mechanism for a cloud project, where we write logs to a file, read from it, append new logs, and handle potential errors.

# File Handling Example: Basic Logging System

# Function to write logs to a file
def write_log(filename, log_message):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:  # Opens the file in write mode
            file.write(log_message + '\n')  # Writes the log message
        print(f"Log written to {filename}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")

# Function to append logs to a file
def append_log(filename, log_message):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'a') as file:  # Opens the file in append mode
            file.write(log_message + '\n')  # Appends the log message
        print(f"Log appended to {filename}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error appending to file: {e}")

# Function to read logs from a file
def read_logs(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:  # Opens the file in read mode
            logs = file.readlines()  # Reads all lines from the file
            print("Logs from file:")
            for log in logs:
                print(log.strip())  # Print each log message without extra spaces
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"No log file found: {filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading from file: {e}")

# Example usage
log_file = 'cloud_project_logs.txt'

# Writing initial log
write_log(log_file, "Starting cloud project deployment...")

# Appending more logs
append_log(log_file, "Step 1: Initialized infrastructure setup.")
append_log(log_file, "Step 2: Deployed resources successfully.")

# Reading logs
read_logs(log_file)

Explanation of the Code:
Function Definitions:
- write_log(filename, log_message): This function takes a filename and a log message. It opens the file in write mode ('w'), writes the log message, and then closes the file automatically using the with statement.
- append_log(filename, log_message): Similar to write_log, but it opens the file in append mode ('a') so new log messages are added without deleting existing ones.
- read_logs(filename): This function reads the log messages from the specified file. If the file doesn't exist, it handles the FileNotFoundError exception and informs the user.

Example Usage:
- A log file named cloud_project_logs.txt is created/used to store log messages.
- The script first writes a log message indicating the start of a deployment process.
- It then appends two more log messages indicating steps taken during the deployment.
- Finally, it reads all log messages from the file and prints them out.

Key Concepts Covered
- File Opening Modes: Writing ('w'), Appending ('a'), Reading ('r').
- Exception Handling: Handling errors such as file not found and other IO exceptions.
- Context Management: Using the with statement for opening files, ensuring they are properly closed after operations.
