This module contains functions for deploying an application and checking its status..
deployment.py

def deploy_application(app_name):
    """Simulate application deployment."""
    print(f"Deploying {app_name}...")
    # Here you would add the code to deploy the app, e.g., using a CI/CD tool.
    return f"{app_name} deployed successfully."

main.py: This is the main script that uses the deployment module.
# main.py

# Importing the functions from deployment module
from deployment import deploy_application, check_status

    # Deploy the application
    deployment_message = deploy_application(app_name)
    print(deployment_message)

#__init__.py: This file can be empty, but it indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.

Functions: deploy_application and check_status are defined to encapsulate the logic for deployment and status checking.
Modules: The deployment.py module contains functions that are imported into main.py.
Packages: The presence of __init__.py signifies that devops_project is a package, which could potentially contain more modules in the future.
