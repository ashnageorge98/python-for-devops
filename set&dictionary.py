Here's a simple Python code demonstrating the use of sets and dictionaries in the context of a DevOps project. 
This code checks for installed packages on servers and ensures that the required packages are installed.

# List of servers and their installed packages
servers = {
    'server1': {'nginx', 'docker', 'python3'},
    'server2': {'nginx', 'mysql', 'python3'},
    'server3': {'docker', 'python3'}
}

# Required packages for all servers
required_packages = {'nginx', 'docker', 'python3'}

# Check which servers are missing required packages
for server, installed_packages in servers.items():
    missing_packages = required_packages - installed_packages  # Set difference
    if missing_packages:
        print(f"{server} is missing: {missing_packages}")
    else:
        print(f"{server} has all required packages installed.")

Explanation:
Servers Dictionary: We have a dictionary servers where each key is a server name, and the value is a set of installed packages on that server (e.g., 'nginx', 'docker', 'python3').
Required Packages Set: We define a set required_packages that contains the packages all servers should have.
Loop Through Servers: We loop through each server and its installed packages using items().
Missing Packages: For each server, we check which required packages are missing by using the set difference (- operator).
Output: The code prints out which servers are missing packages, or if all required packages are installed.
