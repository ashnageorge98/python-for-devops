Hereâ€™s a simple Python code snippet that demonstrates the concepts of lists and tuples in the context of a DevOps project. 
This example simulates a basic scenario where we keep track of deployment environments and their statuses.

# Define a tuple for the deployment environments
environments = ("development", "staging", "production")

# Define a list to store the status of each environment
status_list = []

# Function to check the status of each environment
def check_environment_status():
    for env in environments:
        if env == "production":
            status_list.append(f"{env} is live and stable.")
        else:
            status_list.append(f"{env} is in testing phase.")

# Function to display the status
def display_status():
    print("Deployment Status:")
    for status in status_list:
        print(status)

# Run the functions
check_environment_status()
display_status()

O/P:
Deployment Status:
development is in testing phase.
staging is in testing phase.
production is live and stable.


Explanation
Tuple:

environments: This is a tuple containing the names of the deployment environments: "development", "staging", and "production".
Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation, making them useful for fixed collections of items.
List:

status_list: This is an empty list that will store the status messages for each environment. Lists are mutable, allowing us to add or remove items.
Functions:

check_environment_status(): This function iterates over each environment in the tuple. It checks the environment name and appends a corresponding status message to status_list.
display_status(): This function prints out each status message stored in status_list.
Execution:

We call the functions check_environment_status() to populate the status list and display_status() to print the results.
